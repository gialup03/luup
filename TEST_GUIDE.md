# Testing the Agentic Loop System

## Summary of Changes

âœ… **Model Updated**: Changed from `qwen2.5:3b` to `qwen3:8b` in `src-tauri/src/ollama.rs`
âœ… **Ollama Connection Verified**: Server running at `192.168.0.100:11434` with qwen3:8b available

## Implementation Complete

All files have been created and configured:

### Rust Backend (3 files)
1. âœ… `src-tauri/src/ollama.rs` - Ollama client with streaming
2. âœ… `src-tauri/src/agent.rs` - Agentic loop system  
3. âœ… `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Updated with streaming commands

### Frontend (2 files)
4. âœ… `src/services/backend.ts` - Stream message types
5. âœ… `src/pages/GamePage.tsx` - Streaming UI

### Documentation (4 files)
6. âœ… `AGENTIC_SYSTEM.md` - Architecture documentation
7. âœ… `QUICKSTART.md` - Setup guide
8. âœ… `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Technical details
9. âœ… `README.md` - Updated features

## To Test

### Step 1: Build and Run

Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```

**Expected**: 
- First build takes 5-10 minutes (Rust compilation)
- Window opens with the game interface

### Step 2: Start New Game

1. Click "Start New Adventure"
2. Verify initial state:
   - Location: Mysterious Room
   - Time: Morning
   - Outfit: Traveler's Cloak

### Step 3: Test Streaming

Submit an action, for example:
- "I open the blue door and step through"
- "I examine the room carefully looking for clues"
- "I change into more suitable attire"

**Expected Behavior**:

1. **Streaming Indicator** appears (blue pulsing dot)
2. **Text streams in** word by word
3. **Tool calls** may appear:
   - "Updating time..." (if time changes)
   - "Updating location..." (if location changes)
   - "Updating outfit..." (if outfit changes)
4. **Game state badges** update in real-time
5. **Three new choices** appear when complete
6. **Input is enabled** again

### Step 4: Verify Tool Execution

Try actions that should trigger tools:

**For time change**:
- "I rest for several hours"
- "I wait until evening"

**For location change**:  
- "I leave the room and explore the hallway"
- "I descend the stairs into the cellar"

**For outfit change**:
- "I put on the armor from the chest"
- "I change into the robes I found"

Watch the game state badges (top of story card) update in real-time.

### Step 5: Check Reasoning (Optional)

If the model outputs reasoning:
- Look for the purple "Model Reasoning" panel
- Click to expand and see the model's thought process

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

If you get compilation errors:

1. **Check Cargo.toml dependencies** are correct
2. **Clean build**:
   ```bash
   cd src-tauri
   cargo clean
   cd ..
   npm run tauri:dev
   ```

### "Failed to connect to the storyteller"

If this error appears:

1. **Verify Ollama is running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://192.168.0.100:11434/api/tags
   ```

2. **Check model is available**:
   ```bash
   ollama list | grep qwen3
   ```

3. **Check firewall** if Ollama is on different machine

### No Response from Model

If submission hangs:

1. Check terminal output for Rust errors
2. Open DevTools (F12) and check Console for JS errors
3. Verify Ollama server isn't overloaded

### Tool Calls Not Working

If state doesn't update:

1. Check if model supports function calling (qwen3:8b does)
2. Look at terminal for tool execution logs
3. Try more explicit prompts like "Change time to evening"

## Expected Console Output

### Backend (Terminal)

You should see:
```
Starting development server...
Compiling tauri-adventure...
Running `target/debug/tauri-adventure`
```

When you submit an action, you might see debug output if added.

### Frontend (DevTools Console)

Should be minimal. If you see errors about:
- `agent-stream` events - check event listener setup
- Type errors - TypeScript build issue
- Network errors - Ollama connection problem

## Success Criteria

âœ… App compiles and runs
âœ… New game starts successfully  
âœ… Streaming indicator appears on submit
âœ… Text appears progressively
âœ… Tool calls show progress indicators
âœ… Game state updates in real-time
âœ… Turn completes with new choices
âœ… No errors in console

## What to Look For

### Visual Indicators

1. **Blue pulsing dot** = Streaming in progress
2. **Spinning circle** = Tool executing
3. **Purple panel** = Model reasoning available
4. **Red alert** = Error occurred
5. **State badges** change = Tool executed successfully

### Performance

- **First token**: 500ms-2s after submit
- **Streaming rate**: Smooth, progressive
- **UI responsiveness**: No freezing
- **Tool execution**: Near-instant state updates

## Next Steps After Testing

Once everything works:

1. **Experiment with prompts** - See what triggers tool calls
2. **Customize system prompt** - Edit `src-tauri/src/agent.rs`
3. **Add more tools** - Inventory, quests, etc.
4. **Improve choices** - Better extraction from model output
5. **Add persistence** - Save/load game state

## Files to Check if Issues

### Compilation errors:
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Dependencies
- `src-tauri/src/*.rs` - Syntax errors

### Runtime errors:
- `src-tauri/src/ollama.rs` - Connection/streaming
- `src-tauri/src/agent.rs` - Tool execution
- `src/pages/GamePage.tsx` - Event handling

### Connection errors:
- `src-tauri/src/ollama.rs:77` - Base URL
- `src-tauri/src/ollama.rs:78` - Model name

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] App compiles without errors
- [ ] App launches and shows home page
